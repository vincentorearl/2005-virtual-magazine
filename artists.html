        <h3>Hello David Choe</h3>
          <pre>
David Choe is a Korean-American artist raised in Los Angeles that saw an unexpected rsie in 2012 when he was asked by a new startup company, 
Facebook, to do art for their new building. Choe's street art style is expressive and raw, and his artistry undeniable.
<hr>
Choe is also the drummer in his underground experimental hip-hop / punk-rock / whatever he wants band, <a href="http://www.mangchi.com/" target="_blank">Mangchi</a>.

Mangchi's uniquely free and abrasive sound has led to collaborations with legendary artists like Steve Aoki. 
<hr>
But Choe's number of talents do not stop there... he has also created TV shows for some not so underground networks, namley <em>The Choe Show</em> on Hulu and <em>Thumbs Up</em> for Vice. 

<em>The Choe Show</em> is a series of amazingly strange interviews with some of Choe's favortie people and inspirations rangeing from rapper Denzel Curry, to comideian and writer 
Will Arnett, to porn star Asa Akira. But Choe conducts these interviews in a very emotiomal, spiritual, and therapudic way... all while painting a portrait of each guest
he is interviewing. The show is a beautifully twisted emotional roller coaster and is definetly one of my favortie to come out in 2021.
